💼 Secure Token Wallet on ICP Blockchain 💼

🚀 Overview

Welcome to the Secure Token Wallet built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) blockchain using Rust! This wallet allows users to securely send and receive IRCRC2 tokens, and easily view balances. Perfect for developers exploring blockchain and smart contract development!

🛠 Features
🔹 Send Tokens: Seamlessly transfer IRCRC2 tokens to other addresses.
🔹 Receive Tokens: Automatically receive tokens and see your balance update in real-time.
🔹 Display Balance: Instantly view your current token balance at any time.
📝 Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following tools installed before getting started:

Rust: For smart contract development. Install Rust.

DFX SDK: For deploying and interacting with the ICP network. Install DFX SDK.
Node.js (Optional): Required for web integration if you want to interact with the wallet via a frontend.

🚀 Setup Guide

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/icp-token-wallet.git
cd icp-token-wallet

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
cargo build
dfx install

3️⃣ Start ICP Local Network
dfx start --background

4️⃣ Deploy the Contract
dfx deploy
Now your wallet contract is deployed on a local ICP test network and ready to use!

🔑 Wallet Usage
Send Tokens
Transfer tokens to another address:


dfx canister call icp-token-wallet send_tokens '("recipient_address", amount)'
Receive Tokens
Receive tokens and update your wallet balance:

dfx canister call icp-token-wallet receive_tokens '()'
Check Balance
View your current token balance:


dfx canister call icp-token-wallet get_balance '()'
🧪 Testing
Run unit tests to ensure everything works as expected:


cargo test
This will validate the send/receive functionality and balance display.

🔒 Security
We’ve implemented basic security measures to ensure your token transactions are safe:

Only authorized users can send tokens.
All transactions are validated to prevent errors or unauthorized transfers.
